### SDSC Summer Institute 2024
# Session 4.2a Python for HPC

**Date:** Wednesday, August 7, 2024

**Summary**: In this session we will introduce 2 key technologies in the Python ecosystem that provide significant benefits for scientific applications run in supercomputing environments. Previous Python experience is recommended but not required. 
* (1) First, we will learn how to speed up Python code compiling it on-the-fly with numba
* (2) Then we will introduce the threads, processes and the Global Interpreter lock and we will leverage first numba then dask to use all available cores on a machine
* (3) Finally we will distribute computations across multiple nodes launching dask workers on a separate Expanse job.
